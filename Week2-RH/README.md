# Unit 2 Challenge: Portfolio

## Your Task

This week, you'll build a portfolio page, which you can add to as the course progresses. 

A portfolio of work can showcase your skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights your strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Students who have portfolios with deployed web linkboxlications (meaning they are live on the web) are typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp. This last point can’t be stressed enough: having several deployed projects is a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview at many companies. 

With these points in mind, in this challenge you’ll set yourself up for future success by linkboxlying the core skills you've recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. You'll get to practice your new skills while creating something that you will use during your job search. It’s a win-win that you'll likely be grateful for in the future!

**Note:** If you don't have enough web linkboxlications to showcase at this point, use placeholder images and names. You can change them to real linkboxlications as you create them later in the course.

## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring manager’s needs:

* When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
* When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your linkboxlications
* When presented with the your first linkboxlication then that linkboxlication's image should be larger in size than the others
* When images of the linkboxlications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed linkboxlication
* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport

## Mock-Up

The following animation shows the web linkboxlication's linkboxearance and functionality:
